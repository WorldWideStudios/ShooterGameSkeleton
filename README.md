# Jules

A single level metroidvania-esque shooter. You play as a lone warrior trapped in a spaceship, crashlanded into the ocean, who must shoot and jump her way to the top to escape before the ship fills with water and she drowns.

## Gameplay

- Inspired by Zelda II, the game engine resembles a platformer with a camera such that the player can move left and right (so long as there is a path) and jump their way into the sky (so long as there is platforms or ladders to allow for it.)
