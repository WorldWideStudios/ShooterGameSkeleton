Generate initial project folders, package.json with dependencies (typescript, phaser) with a main page and a basic canvas
that simply draws a ball and nothing else.

Acceptance criteria:

1. Runnable with `npm run dev`
2. Upon running we should have a page with a blank (white) background and a centered canvas
3. The canvas should have a black background, and utilize phaser to draw a red circle in the center of the canvas
4. Ensure compatibility with vite (keep files in the correct location to be ran e.g. index.html not in public but top level)
