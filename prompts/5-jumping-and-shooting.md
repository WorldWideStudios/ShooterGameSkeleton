Building off of movement, lets add jumping with the up arrow and shooting with space.

TODO:

- extend the player actor to jump when pressing the space button
  - make this smooth, the player should jump 1.5 times its own height and be able to double jump if up is pressed twice (no triple jump or anything more than double jump)
- extend the player actor such that when the space bar is hit, the player shoots a red ball in the direction it is facing (if facing left, the red ball goes left, if right the ball goes right) There is no limit on the amount the player can shoot, if they hit space 3 times it should release 3 balls, just ensuring there is a bit of horizontal space between them
- If the player is jumping, the ball shoots upward

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The player can now shoot and jump
